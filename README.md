# MonkeySpeed
MonkeySpeed backported for 1.12 from the TBC version.

### Description:
The MonkeySpeed AddOn for WoW displays your speed as a percentage of run speed.<br>
It can be used everywhere and anytime (run, swim, mount, flying mount, vehicle...)

### Warning:
Settings are not available in this version, because the original addon uses the settings interface available only in the TBC.
